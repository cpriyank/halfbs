</ol>
<p>It’s true that in some places underprivileged humans suffer and are struggling for survival. A lot of people of my home state Gujarat depend on animal husbandary for livelihood. I am not saying we need to create 500000 hectare of parks with people helping them 24x7. But it’s perfectly possible to improve living conditions <em>slightly</em> for animals, and <em>slightly reduce dependence</em> on animal products if your moral values are consistent.</p>
<p>I also recognize that there are some genuine justifications on eating animals or consuming their milk:</p>
<p>Historically, not all cultures were blessed to be in a place suitable for agriculture There were also not enough sources for nutrition. People ate or drank whatever possible to survive.</p>
<p>Since survival was of the highest importance, the standards of success/wealth in those cultures also revolved around having more animals to use for survival.</p>
<p>In other words, our perception of beauty/success is influenced by our assessment of someone or something’s chances of long-term survival or the benefit they provide to us.</p>
<p>(A contrived example: A family with 20 cows is considered more successful than a family with 1 billion rats, because the cows are more useful for survival. If in future, some scientists discover with strong evidence that eating liver of rats of Great Victorian Desert cures cancer and governments/religious authorities approve it, equations will change.)</p>
<p>Even if a bunch of rational people emerge in that culture, consuming animal products is sometimes required for socializing.
(e.g. lf you don’t follow certain diet, some groups can exclude you from gatherings altogether out of apparent holier-than-thou attitude.)
Culture cannot change overnight. Nothing wrong with it</p>
<p>When you change diet, you need to ensure that you get all the nutrients/supplements and do not develop any deficiencies.</p>
<p>At an individual level, this level of thinking is hard; and therefore most people do what others in their groups are doing, or what they themselves had been doing before new knowledge is revealed.
Sometimes, there are genuine reasons to do this, but not always.</p>
<p>Because of how our society is organized, some people require government or religious leaders to delcare this any new knowledge as truth.
(e.g. People refused to believe that we evolved from apes for 130 years after publication of Darwin’s theory. Kepler published that Earth is not the center of the universe in 1609, but majority of religions, governments, and people believed, until 19th century that we are at the center of the Universe with some special godly purpose. Anyone who claimed otherwise was jailed or threatened (including Galileo, who demonstrated this by experiment))</p>
<p>If you were previously not consuming animals, but later switched because you were curious about taste, texture, smell, or social acceptance, a good uncomfortable analogy is to ask if you will support a rape or murder of an innocent person because you were curious how you would enjoy it.</p>
<p>If you feel that the intelligent have the right to dominate the “lesser” ones, I’m very happy that you’re not designing Al.
The future doesn’t look good for humans if we design Al to dominate over less intelligent us.</p>
<p>Notes: I deliberately avoided euphemisms used by industry, such as “meat/beef/ham/pork” rather than dead cow/pig, to divert attention away from fact that animals are sentient beings</p>
<p>Speaking personally, I find it uneasy discussing this issue with my family/friends. There is always a fear that it might introduce tension or conflicts in relationships, fear of being judged as self-righteous, or worry that they might feel I’m judging them for not following my cult.
Often, I just don’t talk about it in a large group, but I feel it’s important to confront people we care about, perhaps more important than confronting adversaries. It’s one of the few ways to bring about moral or cultural change without relying on a powerful authority.</p></div><ul class="sc-dkPulx Ldomq"></ul></div></article></main><footer class="sc-gsDKeI hiKQsD footer">© <!-- -->2023<!-- -->,<!-- --> <a href="https://halfbs.github.io">halfbs.github.io</a>.
