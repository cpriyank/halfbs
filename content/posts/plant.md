(Read notes at the end on choice of words. I'm not attacking or pointing fingers at specific groups or cultures, nor am I defending any. I also do not think anyone can change overnight or change completely all the time. I'm only urging some genuine thinking, reflection, dialog, and optional actions to change habits or norms, all of which are becoming increasingly rare)

Here are some points which have very good or undeniable evidence:

1. When our brain faces new knowledge which conflicts with existing knowledge or requires changes in everyday decisions, brain can invent very scientific-sounding justifications to reject that evidence (see Cognitive Dissonance and Confirmation Bias).

Real life example: a generally sane person in my community says that they eat a lot of chilli peppers, therefore they will not develop diabetes even if they eat a lot of sweets. In their mind, the spiciness of chili peppers cancels out the adverse effects of excess sugar

2. Animals have neurons and are therefore capable of feelings of intense pain, suffering, freedom, sex, love for family, need to be with children/parents.

For an analogy, imagine how you would feel if your government, employer, or other institution (e.g. patriarchy) forces you to breed artificially with someone so that you have 50 high performing children by their standards

3. Most of the animals used for dairy are kept in conditions considered inhumane

4. Most animals are bred/hybridized not to support their own needs, but to maximize human valued yields (more or better milk/honey/meat/leather etc). If our intention was to protect them from wild animals, we would not force breed or impregnate them.

5. Not all cows develop mastitis if they are not milked. If the intention is to save them from mastitis, better approach is to not milk them at all, because milking them exposes them to bacteria or risks mammary tissue damage. 

6. There are large scale meta-studies over longer periods which show that well balanced, purely plant based diet with supplements have no risks of deficiency or health concerns

7. At personal level, in case you like eating, drinking, or using animal products because of taste, habit, texture, or durability, it is possible, though I admit slightly uncomfortable, to imagine or watch videos of conditions in which animals are kept over their lifetime.

If you watch them, you will certainly not feel more than 1% of pain that they feel. I generally do not like to be a salesman, but in this case, not thinking enough supports an industry that systematically exploits them. 

8. In any system, if demand reduces supply will reduce. In countries where people are adopting plant based diet(cities of UK, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, US, Australia), production of animal products has reduced. Tesla and a lot of other new EVs have vegan leather

It's true that in some places, underprivileged humans suffer struggle for survival. A lot of people of my home state Gujarat depend on animal husbandry for livelihood. I am not saying we need to create 500000 hectare of parks with people helping them 24x7. But it's perfectly possible to improve living conditions *slightly* for animals, and *slightly reduce dependence* on animal products if your moral values are consistent. I am not going to discuss benefits to adopting plant based diet to sustainability; The little Giant that is Greta Thunberg writes better about it.

I also recognize that there are some genuine justifications on eating animals or consuming their milk:

Historically, not all cultures were blessed to be in a place suitable for agriculture. There were also not enough sources for nutrition. People ate or drank whatever possible to survive.

Since survival was of the highest importance, the standards of success/wealth in those cultures also revolved around having more animals to use for survival.

Our perception of beauty/success are also influenced by our assessment of someone or something's chances of long-term survival or the benefit they provide to us.

(A contrived example: A family with 20 cows is considered more successful than a family with 1 billion rats, because the cows are more useful for survival. If in future, some scientists discover with strong evidence that eating liver of rats of Great Victorian Desert cures cancer and governments/religious authorities approve it, equations will change)

Even if a bunch of rational people emerge in that culture, consuming animal products is sometimes required for socializing.
(e.g. If you don't follow certain diet, some groups can exclude you from gatherings altogether out of apparent holier-than-thou attitude.)
Culture cannot change overnight. Nothing wrong with it.

When you change diet, you need to ensure that you get all the nutrients/supplements and do not develop any deficiencies. You also need to possibly change your daily rituals or habits. Until you either change a habit or give up, this extra intentional thinking is required everyday.

At an individual level, this level of thinking is hard; and therefore most people do what others in their groups are doing, or what they themselves had been doing before new knowledge is revealed to them.
Sometimes, there are genuine reasons to mimic others, but not always.

Because of how our society is organized, some people require government or religious leaders to declare any new knowledge as truth.
(e.g. People refused to believe that we evolved from apes for 130 years after publication of Darwin's theory. Kepler published that Earth is not the center of the universe in 1609, but majority of religions, governments, and people believed, until 19th century, that we are at the center of the Universe, with some special godly purpose. Anyone who claimed otherwise was jailed or threatened (including Galileo, who demonstrated this by experiment))

If you were previously not consuming animals, but later switched because you were curious about taste, texture, smell, or social acceptance, a good uncomfortable analogy is to ask if you will support a rape or murder of an innocent person because you were curious how you would enjoy it. Again, animals are very much capable of complex feelings.

If you feel that the intelligent have the right to dominate the "lesser" ones, I'm very happy that you're not designing Al.
The future doesn't look good for humans if we design Al to dominate over less intelligent us.

Notes: I deliberately avoided euphemisms used by industry, such as "meat/beef/ham/pork" rather than "exploited" or "dead cow/pig"; industry does that to divert attention away from fact that animals are sentient beings.

Speaking personally, I find it uneasy discussing this issue with my family/friends. There is always a fear that it might introduce tension or conflicts in relationships, fear of being judged as self-righteous, or worry that they might feel I'm judging them for not following my cult.
Often, I just don't talk about it in a large group. But I feel it's important to confront people we care about, perhaps more important than confronting adversaries. It's one of the few ways to bring about moral or cultural change without relying on a powerful authority.
