You tender thing.
<br>
The thread spools between your teeth.
<br>
For all the binding to hold me in place,
<br>
it's you who's deliciously bound.
<br>
You're bound for the same
<br>
shucking and tearing that
<br>
little bows can beckon.
<br>
They say measure twice and cut once.
<br>
You trace my back absentmindedly.
<br>
It's practically in tatters.
<br>
No different from the red pulsing of
<br>
your inner thighs, handily rendered.
<br>
Thread spools between your teeth.
<br>
You were such a mouthful.
<br>
And as with anything well-bound,
<br>
now that my tongue is free, it seeks
<br>
refuge along your spine
<br>
An escaped prisoner, hoping for a longer sentence.
<br>
The way we rend one another-- no wonder
<br>
we weave all this thread.
<br>
We tie the most wonderful knots
<br>
where we hope to unravel.
<br>
All a frenzy of nails and teeth,
<br>
tongues and succulent phrases.
<br>
All this thread; you wrap around my waist.
