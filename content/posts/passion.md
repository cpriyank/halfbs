Passion is not mastery,
<br>
Strong feelings are
<br>
neither facts nor keen understanding.
<br>

Our convictions take courage,
<br>
to swim against the current,
<br>
to be true.
<br>

<br>
That ceaseless flow spares no one.
<br>
We drown in knowledge,
<br>
and we feel we know that ocean.
<br>

Our souls cry for others,
<br>
our minds eject what they can
<br>
to take on new horrors, bold.
<br>

We are finite,
<br>
foaming at the mouth,
<br>
of infinite arrays of information, in scores.
<br>
We know enough to react,
<br>
but often not enough,
<br>
to prevent the tragedies that come our way, and more.
<br>

Things are euphoric or vicious,
<br>
and then,
<br>
they are washed away.
<br>
For many, a lack of knowledge leads to
<br>
fanaticism on the subject at hand.
<br>
They attack what they don’t grasp,
<br>
and sway.
<br>

It is beautiful to be bold and unabashed,
<br>
but propaganda works best on the beautiful, alas.
<br>
Look carefully before you misguide another’s gaze,
<br>
before lunging into false battles,
<br>
with no end in sight, and pass.
<br>

Passion is not expertise,
<br>
but neither is a restrained armchair view.
<br>
And I’d take the passionate over the poised any day,
<br>
with delight, anew.
<br>

Between the empathetic and apathetic,
<br>
the former will get informed,
<br>
As long as they’re not caught up
<br>
in some performance,
<br>
they’ll learn, and be transformed.
