Passion is not mastery,
<hr>
Strong feelings are
<hr>
neither facts nor keen understanding.
<hr>

Our convictions take courage,
<hr>
to swim against the current,
<hr>
to be true.
<hr>

<hr>
That ceaseless flow spares no one.
<hr>
We drown in knowledge,
<hr>
and we feel we know that ocean.
<hr>

Our souls cry for others,
<hr>
our minds eject what they can
<hr>
to take on new horrors, bold.
<hr>

We are finite,
<hr>
foaming at the mouth,
<hr>
of infinite arrays of information, in scores.
<hr>
We know enough to react,
<hr>
but often not enough,
<hr>
to prevent the tragedies that come our way, and more.
<hr>

Things are euphoric or vicious,
<hr>
and then,
<hr>
they are washed away.
<hr>
For many, a lack of knowledge leads to
<hr>
fanaticism on the subject at hand.
<hr>
They attack what they don’t grasp,
<hr>
and sway.
<hr>

It is beautiful to be bold and unabashed,
<hr>
but propaganda works best on the beautiful, alas.
<hr>
Look carefully before you misguide another’s gaze,
<hr>
before lunging into false battles,
<hr>
with no end in sight, and pass.
<hr>

Passion is not expertise,
<hr>
but neither is a restrained armchair view.
<hr>
And I’d take the passionate over the poised any day,
<hr>
with delight, anew.
<hr>

Between the empathetic and apathetic,
<hr>
the former will get informed,
<hr>
As long as they’re not caught up
<hr>
in some performance,
<hr>
they’ll learn, and be transformed.
<hr>
