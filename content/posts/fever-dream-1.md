I didn't open myself up just
<br>
for you to crawl in and die.
<br>
I am no field for you to haunt
<br>
This is no place for a final stand.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes people think love
<br>
is an opportunity to give up
<br>
or go down swinging.
<br>
There's nothing loving
<br>
about a lost cause.
<br>
Some people love like lepers and
<br>
others love taking others' limbs.
<br>
<br>
It's lecherous, looking at
<br>
someone desperate to be held
<br>
and holding them away.
<br>
<br>
It's lecherous, giving them only the parts
<br>
of yourself you don't mind getting lost.
<br>
It's lecherous, losing sight of
<br>
the heart beating beneath decay.
<br>
<br>
Look me in the eye so
<br>
I can blink you away.
<br>
I've seen more love in
<br>
bile-bearing boasts than
<br>
in your defeated sighs.
<br>
<br>
You really do hear love
<br>
before you see it. It's
<br>
more than the throat you held.
<br>
<br>
My beloved taught my whole flesh
<br>
to gasp and warble.
<br>
If you love me well then maybe,
<br>
down the muddy line,
<br>
we'll have given the crows
<br>
something worth feasting on.
<br>
