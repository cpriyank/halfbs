Just because there is suffering in art,
<br>
doesn't mean there is art in suffering.
<br>
I see it with disturbing frequency: pain framed as
<br>
inherently romantic, worthwhile for its own sake
<br>
Suffering simplified, made consumable, aesthetically pleasant-
<br>
tell me, does it really hurt so good?
<br>
<br>
Only then, when there's no context, no challenge
<br>
I've seen art which falls short in its framing of suffering:
<br>
a lazy and superficial spotlight.
<br>
<br>
Stood starkly, there is no denying
<br>
in that light; yes, there is suffering.
<br>
So what? Too often, no elaboration is offered,
<br>
as if highlighting the obvious were some
<br>
noble act, as if gawking at agony made us
<br>
any less vulnerable, any less culpable.
<br>
<br>
How brave, taking abject traumas and reappropriating them,
<br>
turning them tame. To put one's own lamentations on display,
<br>
or cradle another's, until the cameras are off.
<br>
<br>
I think people fundamentally misunderstand the Russian Classics
<br>
(and Cowboy Bebop).
<br>
They listen to a person laying themselves bare, wailing
<br>
about losses, inner turmoil, dependence, anguish;
<br>
they listen and think "it's about suffering"
<br>
But it isn't. The blues are about transience
<br>
about pain along a lifelong path, aimlessness
<br>
as a consequence of being a traveler.
<br>
<br>
It's an art that frames suffering as a fact, not a fascination.
<br>
There's nothing to romanticize; only something to endure.
<br>
There's more to suffering than art, and more to art than suffering.
<br>
Pain does not make anything more palatable, nor potent
<br>
When you've cried long enough to feel warm,
<br>
you've also likely laughed hard enough for it to hurt.
<br>
There's nuance, contradiction, and variety in the
<br>
human experience
<br>
<br>
A romantic view of suffering is quite easy when you're numb.
<br>
But when you feel, and you hit that blue note, you wake, and
<br>
know quite well:
<br>
"You're gonna carry that weight."
