Our blurring is as sudden
as it is constant.
Between us all are chasms.
It can be frustrating, especially at first, to be
misunderstood while shouting over that void.
But the two ends, never truly apart, manage to
converge. We are heard in each other's arms.

We are held, suspended, in the breeding ground of echoes
We diminish, we erode ourselves
to make bridges over absence.
Creation is separation. We, created, come
together in our necessary destruction.
Complications are sure to arise.
To be understood, we must dissolve.
We must be willing to engage
in mutual annihilation.
Mutual conjunction. Most emptiness in creation contains
the very same fundamental material we exhaust over.
The lack between that created space-- divine.
It can be worrisome; we,
who depend on others, must
expose ourselves to them.
It sure leaves me weary.
But glad, too.
For all the barbs and blows I've sustained,
in the end, in my weariness, I've found
skin which listens.
I know it will be the same for you.


Your blurring is as sudden,
as constant as the breath of dawn.
Between us stretch vast chasms,
silent voids where echoes falter.

Frustration blooms, especially at first,
when misunderstood words ricochet,
shouting futilely across the abyss.
Yet, the two ends, never truly apart,
find their way to convergence.

In each other's arms, we are heard,
suspended like dew-kissed spider silk,
swaying in the breeding ground of echoes.
We diminish, erode ourselves,
forge bridges over absence.

Creation, you see, is separation.
We, created, come together
in our necessary destruction.
Complications arise, tangled threads,
and to be understood, we must dissolve.

Mutual annihilation, a paradoxical possibility,
where we willingly engage in dissolution.
Embrace the void, my weary friend,
for most emptiness in creation
holds the same fundamental material
we exhaust over and over.

That lack, that space between,
it is divine, a sacred pause.
Worrisome, yes, to expose ourselves,
to depend on others, to risk vulnerability.
Yet, in weariness, there lies a revelation.

For amidst the barbs and blows I endured,
in the end, in my cuddling pillow,
I discover skin that listens,
a tender membrane attuned to whispers.
I wonder, do you feel that fleeting urge,
to kiss and cuddle across the star-laden abyss?
