> **Note:** Agkorexia is derived from Greek *Agkalia* (cuddle, embrace) and *Orexis* (longing, desire). *Basos* is kiss

> At midnight, the spectral purrs of a Singaporean kitty and the Rodin whispered secrets I saw yesterday at Stanford's Cantor Museum danced in my dreams, creating a haunting fugue.

Your blurring is as sudden,
as constant as the breath of dawn.
Between us stretch vast chasms,
silent voids where echoes falter.

Frustration blooms, especially at first,
when misunderstood words ricochet,
shouting futilely across the abyss.
Yet, the two ends, never truly apart,
find their way to convergence.

In each other's arms, we are heard,
suspended like dew-kissed spider silk,
swaying in the breeding ground of echoes.
We diminish, erode ourselves,
forge bridges over absence.

Creation, you see, is separation.
We, created, come together
in our necessary destruction.
Complications arise, tangled threads,
and to be understood, we must dissolve.

Mutual annihilation, a paradoxical possibility,
where we willingly engage in dissolution.

Embrace the void, my weary friend,
for most emptiness in creation
holds the same fundamental material
we exhaust over and over.

That lack, that space between,
it is divine, a sacred pause.
Worrisome, yes, to expose ourselves,
to depend on others, to risk vulnerability.

Yet, in weariness, there lies a revelation.

For amidst the barbs and blows I endured,
in the end, in my boudoir pillow,
![despair]([https://framemark.vam.ac.uk/collections/2006AX9926/full/full/0/default.jpg](https://framemark.vam.ac.uk/collections/2006AX9926/full/full/0/default.jpg))
I discover skin that listens,
a tender membrane attuned to whispers.
I wonder, do you feel that fleeting urge,
to kiss and cuddle across the star-laden abyss?
