Your blurring is as sudden,
<br>
as constant as the breath of dawn.
<br>
Between us stretch vast chasms,
<br>
silent voids where echoes falter.
<br>

Frustration blooms, especially at first,
<br>
when misunderstood words ricochet,
<br>
shouting futilely across the abyss.
<br>
Yet, the two ends, never truly apart,
<br>
find their way to convergence.
<br>

In each other's arms, we are heard,
<br>
suspended like dew-kissed spider silk,
<br>
swaying in the breeding ground of echoes.
<br>
We diminish, erode ourselves,
<br>
forge bridges over absence.
<br>

<br>
Creation, you see, is separation.
<br>
We, created, come together
<br>
in our necessary destruction.
<br>
Complications arise, tangled threads,
<br>
and to be understood, we must dissolve.
<br>

Mutual annihilation, a paradoxical possibility,
<br>
where we willingly engage in dissolution.

<br>
Embrace the void, my weary friend,
<br>
for most emptiness in creation
<br>
holds the same fundamental material
<br>
we exhaust over and over.
<br>

That lack, that space between,
<br>
it is divine, a sacred pause.
<br>
Worrisome, yes, to expose ourselves,
<br>
to depend on others, to risk vulnerability.
<br>

<br>
Yet, in weariness, there lies a revelation.
<br>

For amidst the barbs and blows I endured,
<br>
in the end, in my boudoir pillow,
<br>
![desespoir](https://frenchart.umsl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Rodin-Desespoir.jpg)
<br>
I discover skin that listens,
<br>
a tender membrane attuned to whispers.
<br>
I wonder, do you feel that fleeting urge,
<br>
to kiss and cuddle across the star-laden abyss?
