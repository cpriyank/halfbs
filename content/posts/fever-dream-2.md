In cauterizing all these wounds,
<br>
I've burned myself alive.
<br>
<br>
In cauterizing all these words,
<br>
there's no page left to write on.
<br>
The ink boils in the pen and sears
<br>
the skin. I remember in such a way.
<br>
What pour out molten and shaky
<br>
seem illegible, but those are always
<br>
the most printable of my pains.
<br>
<br>
In cauterizing all these worries,
<br>
no wonder I wake up in cold sweats.
<br>
No matter how well I manage
<br>
to numb myself over, there are
<br>
the parts which peek, ablaze.
<br>
Caught between the world
<br>
and my walls, I make do
<br>
with inane distractions.
<br>
In those little victories, I lose a lot.
<br>
<br>
In cauterizing all these wails, I've
<br>
bottled myself too tight to burst.
<br>
I've been on the verge for so long that
<br>
I'Il never tip over. A true homebody.
<br>
I've made my home at the
<br>
threshold of true expression.
<br>
Honestly, I'm still holding back now.
<br>
<br>
In cauterizing all these wants,
<br>
I may never catch fire again.
<br>
You tell me that I'm always
<br>
warm, but time will tell.
<br>
With desperate enough breath,
<br>
the smallest ember pulses.
<br>
I guess it remains a call and response-
<br>
I'Il try listening a little harder.
<br>
