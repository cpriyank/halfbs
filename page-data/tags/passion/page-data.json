Basos is kiss Our blurring is as sudden\nas it is constant.\nBetween us all are chasms.\nIt can be frustrating, especially at first, to be\nmisunderstood while shouting over that void.\nBut the two ends, never truly apart, manage to\nconverge.

We, created, come\ntogether in our necessary destruction.\nComplications are sure to arise.\nTo be understood, we must dissolve.\nWe must be willing to engage\nin mutual annihilation.\nMutual conjunction. Most emptiness in creation contains\nthe very same fundamental material we exhaust over.\nThe lack between that created space— divine.\nIt can be worrisome; we,\nwho depend on others, must\nexpose ourselves to them.\nIt sure leaves me weary.\nBut glad, too.\nFor all the barbs and blows I’ve sustained,\nin the end, in my weariness, I’ve found\nskin which listens.\nI know it will be the same for you. Your blurring is as sudden,\nas constant as the breath of dawn.\nBetween us stretch vast chasms,\nsilent voids where echoes falter. Frustration blooms, especially at first,\nwhen misunderstood words ricochet,\nshouting futilely across the abyss.\nYet, the two ends, never truly apart,\nfind their way to convergence. In each other’s arms, we are heard,\nsuspended like dew-kissed spider silk,\nswaying in the breeding ground of echoes.\nWe diminish, erode ourselves,\nforge bridges over absence. Creation, you see, is separation.\nWe, created, come together\nin our necessary destruction.\nComplications arise, tangled threads,\nand to be understood, we must dissolve. Mutual annihilation, a paradoxical possibility,\nwhere we willingly engage in dissolution.\nEmbrace the void, my weary friend,\nfor most emptiness in creation\nholds the same fundamental material\nwe exhaust over and over. That lack, that space between,\nit is divine, a sacred pause.\nWorrisome, yes, to expose ourselves,\nto depend on others, to risk vulnerability.\nYet, in weariness, there lies a revelation. For amidst the barbs and blows I endured,\nin the end, in my cuddling pillow,\nI discover skin that listens,\na tender membrane attuned to whispers.\nI wonder, do you feel that fleeting urge,\nto kiss and cuddle across the star-laden abyss?","fields":{"slug":"/basorexia-agkorexia/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2023-12-27","title":"Basorexia | Agkorexia"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"passion"}},"staticQueryHashes":["712016698"],"slicesMap":{}}
