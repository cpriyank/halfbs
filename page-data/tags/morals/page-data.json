I’m not attacking or pointing fingers at specific groups or cultures, nor am I defending any. I also do not think anyone can change overnight or change completely all the time. I’m only urging some genuine thinking, reflection, dialog, and optional actions to change habits or norms, all of which are becoming increasingly rare) Here are some points which have very good or undeniable evidence: When our brain faces new knowledge which conflicts with existing knowledge or requires changes in everyday decisions, brain can invent very scientific-sounding justifications to reject that evidence (see Cognitive Dissonance and Confirmation Bias). Real life example: a generally sane person in my community says that they eat a lot of chilli peppers, therefore they will not develop diabetes even if they eat a lot of sweets. In their mind, the spiciness of chili peppers cancels out the adverse effects of excess sugar Animals have neurons and are therefore capable of feelings of intense pain, suffering, freedom, sex, love for family, need to be with children/parents. For an analogy, imagine how you would feel if your government, employer, or other institution (e.g. patriarchy) forces you to breed artificially with someone so that you have 50 high performing children by their standards Most of the animals used for dairy are kept in conditions considered inhumane Most animals are bred/hybridized not to support their own needs, but to maximize human valued yields (more or better milk/honey/meat/leather etc). If our intention was to protect them from wild animals, we would not force breed or impregnate them. Not all cows develop mastitis if they are not milked. If the intention is to save them from mastitis, better approach is to not milk them at all, because milking them exposes them to bacteria or risks mammary tissue damage. There are large scale meta-studies over longer periods which show that well balanced, purely plant based diet with supplements have no risks of deficiency or health concerns At personal level, in case you like eating, drinking, or using animal products because of taste, habit, texture, or durability, it is possible, though I admit slightly uncomfortable, to imagine or watch videos of conditions in which animals are kept over their lifetime. If you watch them, you will certainly not feel more than 1% of pain that they feel.
